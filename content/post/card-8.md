My favorite hobby is game development, and I've been messing with it off-and-on since I was thirteen years old.

* [PuttPutt Pro Tour](https://sammynilla.itch.io/puttputt-pro-tour): 3D miniature golf game project made in Unity.
* [Clashing Cubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_geaGBTopo): A quick puzzle game I made for a forum competition.
