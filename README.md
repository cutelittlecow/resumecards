## ðŸ’¼ Installation ðŸ’¼

**Note:** This port of ResumeCards uses Hugo. Please read [Hugo's documentation](http://gohugo.io/) if you get stuck.

Fork this repo, clone it, and then run:

```
hugo server
```

Use build.bat currently on windows (no multiplatform tools currently, sorry) to compile and compress resumecards.scss if you make changes.
### Warning

* Once the server is started, you must go to [http://localhost:1313/resumecards/](http://localhost:1313/resumecards/), since `baseURL` is set as `"/resumecards/"` initially. To use  http://localhost:1313/, change `baseURL` in `config.yml` to `""` .

## ðŸ’¼ Usage ðŸ’¼

### Editing Your Resume

Edit `_posts/card-[1-9].md` like this:

```markdown
---
type: "Work Experience"
heading: "Bizreach"
subheading: "Junior Product Designer"
duration: "October 2013 â€“ September 2014 (1 year)"
location: "Tokyo, Japan"
---

Write in markdown here...
```

If you don't need some of the metadata, just remove them:

```markdown
---
type: "Work Experience"
heading: "Bizreach"
---
```

### Other Files to Modify

You **should** change these files before deploying:

* `config.yml`: You must change `baseurl` and `url`.
  * Make sure to restart the server after you update `config.yml`.
* `data/resume.yml`: You must change `photo`, `name` and `url`. Also, you must set `demo` to `false` to hide everything but your resume.
* `CNAME`: Change this to host ResumeCards on a custom domain.
* `README.md`: Write your own README!
* `layouts/partials/include/scripts.html`: Extra stuff before the `</body>` tag. Change or remove the default Google Analytics code.
* `layouts/partials/include/social.html`: Modify or remove your contact links.

### Customize the Theme

~~To customize the color theme, edit the `color` section of `data/resume.yml`.~~  
**Note:** One of the pitfalls of using Hugo vs Jekyll is the fact that Hugo doesnt support Yaml front matter in Sass. This unfortunately currently makes the `color` section of `data/resume.yml` not work as intended. To change colors currently, you'll need to edit the following, changing default to whatever color you choose:
```
$theme-color: map-get(map-get($all-colors, "default"), "base");
$theme-sub: map-get(map-get($all-colors, "default"), "sub");
$theme-text: map-get(map-get($all-colors, "default"), "text");
$theme-muted: map-get(map-get($all-colors, "default"), "muted");
$theme-bg: map-get(map-get($all-colors, "default"), "bg");
$theme-heading: map-get(map-get($all-colors, "default"), "heading");
```
